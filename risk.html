        <h2>📘 PMBOK</h2>
        <p>Provides a dedicated knowledge area for risk (planning, identification, analysis, response, monitoring). Issues are managed through escalation paths, integrated into monitoring and controlling processes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box" data-animate>
        <h2>📗 PRINCE2</h2>
        <p>Uses a Risk Theme with a Risk Register and Issue Register. Issues are categorized (change, off-specification, problem/concern) and escalated through formal controls and tolerances.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box" data-animate>
        <h2>📙 ISO</h2>
        <p>ISO 21502 emphasizes identifying, analyzing, and treating risks at project and program levels. Issues are deviations requiring corrective action and are documented for organizational learning.</p>

        <h2>✅ Similarities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All recognize risks and issues as separate but related concepts.</li>
          <li>Each requires structured documentation and escalation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box highlight" data-animate>
        <h2>⚖️ Differences</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PMBOK = knowledge area focus; PRINCE2 = risk/issue registers and tolerances; ISO = high-level governance guidance.</li>
